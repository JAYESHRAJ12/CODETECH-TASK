Project Overview: Password Strength Checker


Purpose


The purpose of this project is to evaluate the strength of a user's password and provide feedback based on its complexity. The program assesses the password by checking for the presence of various character types and the length of the password. Based on these criteria, the program calculates a score and categorizes the password as weak, moderate, or strong.


Key Features:


Length Analysis: Check the length of the password.


Complexity Analysis: Evaluate the presence of uppercase letters, lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.


Uniqueness Analysis: Assess the variety and uniqueness of characters used.


Functionality:


Input: User enters a password.


Processing: Algorithms analyze the password based on predefined criteria (length, complexity, uniqueness).


Output: Provide a score and feedback on the passwordâ€™s strength, with suggestions for improvement if needed.


Benefits:


Helps users create stronger, more secure passwords.


Enhances overall cybersecurity by promoting better password practices.
